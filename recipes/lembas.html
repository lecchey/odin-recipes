    <ul>
    <li>Prep Time: 2 hours</li>
    <li>Bake Time: 30 minutes</li>
    <li>Rising Time: 1 hour 30 minutes</li>
    <li>Total Time: 4 hours</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (90°-110°F)</li>
        <li>2 tespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet active rise yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon italian seasoning, extra for topping, to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil for baking</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil for topping</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Fleur de Sel (or flaky salt) for topping, optional</li>
        <li>spray cooking oil, optional</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the water and sugar. 
            Then sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the warm water and let it 
            develop for 15 minutes, or until the surface of the water is frothy and doubled in size.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and Italian seasoning. Slowly add the 
            dry ingredients to the bowl of the stand mixer on medium speed. Continue to stir until a thick, 
            sticky dough forms—about 10 minutes. Cover and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, grease a baking sheet with olive oil, then spray it with cooking oil to help give 
            the bread a crispy bottom. Pour the dough onto the baking sheet. <b>Do not roll or knead the dough.</b> </li>
        <li>Drizzle olive oil over the top of the dough. Use your fingertips to press into the dough to make 
            divots. Gently tip the pan from side to side to help the dough reach almost all the way to the 
            corners (it shouldn't fill the pan completely but should reach about ½ inch from the edges all
             the way around).</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap greased with cooking spray. Let the dough rise in a warm spot until
             doubled in size—if your house is on the cooler side, this can take 90 minutes or longer.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Sprinkle additional Italian seasoning on top as desired. Bake for 20-30 minutes, 
            checking every 5 minutes after the 20-minute mark, until the focaccia is puffed up and baked 
            through. The bread should be pale but golden brown around the edges. It will be ready when it is pulling
             away from the edges of the pan.</li>
        <li>Let the bread cool on the pan on a cooling rack for 30 minutes. Then lift the bread from the pan and 
            finish cooling on the rack.</li>
        <li>Finish the bread with Fleur de Sel mixed with Italian seasoning to create a "salt from the Shire." 
            Spread on homemade butter, jam, and more! Enjoy with your best mate after a long journey to toss a
            ring into a volcano.</li>
